# Day 6 – Time Series Analysis & Forecasting

## Project Title
Predicting Future Airline Passenger Demand using Time Series Models

## Objective
To build a time series forecasting model by:
- Analyzing trend and seasonality
- Making the series stationary using ADF test
- Building ARIMA and SARIMA models
- Forecasting future passenger demand

## Key Techniques Used
- Time Series Decomposition
- ADF Stationarity Test (p-value < 0.05)
- Log & Differencing Transformations
- ARIMA and SARIMA Models

## Outcome
SARIMA outperformed ARIMA by capturing both trend and seasonality.
