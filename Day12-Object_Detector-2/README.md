#  – Object Detector

This project implements a real-world object detection system using pre-trained YOLO models (YOLOv8 and YOLO26 variants) in Google Colab.  
The system performs object detection on video data and visualizes detected objects using bounding boxes and confidence scores.

## Tasks Performed
- Object detection on video input
- Detection and classification of real-world objects using YOLO
- Visualization of bounding boxes and confidence scores

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- YOLO (YOLOv8 and related variants)
- OpenCV
- Google Colab
