# Day19 – AI Agents

This project demonstrates the implementation of AI Agents that can
reason, plan, and take actions to complete tasks autonomously.

## 📌 Objective
To understand how AI Agents use Large Language Models (LLMs)
along with tools to perform multi-step problem solving.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- LangChain / LLM APIs
- Tool-based Architecture
- Prompt Engineering
- Google Colab

## 🤖 What are AI Agents?
AI Agents are systems that:
1. Understand user goals.
2. Decide what actions to take.
3. Use tools (search, calculator, database, etc.).
4. Execute tasks step-by-step.
5. Return intelligent results.

## 🔄 Workflow
User Query → Agent Reasoning → Tool Usage → Response Generation

## 🔎 Example Tasks
- "Summarize this document."
- "Analyze this dataset."
- "Search and explain a concept."
- "Plan steps to solve a problem."

## ✅ Outcome
This project shows how AI Agents move beyond simple chatbots
and perform goal-driven intelligent automation.
