# Day 14 – Build Your Own GPT (Custom Text Generation Engine)

## 📌 Objective
Build a custom GPT-style language model using TinyStories dataset and perform controlled inference.

## 🔧 Tasks Completed
- Loaded TinyStories dataset in streaming mode.
- Built a lightweight GPT architecture using Transformers.
- Trained model safely within Colab memory limits.
- Saved checkpoints for reuse.
- Generated story text from trained model.
- Implemented domain-restricted inference (Python-only responses).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- HuggingFace Transformers
- Google Colab
- Streaming Dataset Handling

## 📊 Outcome
Successfully trained and tested a small GPT model and controlled its responses using filtering + prompt engineering.
