# Day 7 – Preventing Customer Churn

## Project Title
Feature Engineering for Customer Churn Prediction

## Objective
To demonstrate how feature engineering and feature selection improve customer churn prediction by comparing:
- A baseline model
- A model with engineered features
- A model with selected features

## Key Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Feature Selection
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Feature Importance


## Outcome
Feature engineering improved churn prediction performance, while feature selection did not provide additional gains for this dataset.
