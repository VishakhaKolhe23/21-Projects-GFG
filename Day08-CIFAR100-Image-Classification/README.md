# Day 8 – CIFAR-100 Image Classification

## Project Title
CIFAR-100 Image Classification using ANN and CNN

## Objective
To apply ANN and CNN models to the CIFAR-100 dataset and analyze how model architecture impacts performance on a complex image classification task.

## Dataset
CIFAR-100 dataset containing 60,000 color images across 100 classes.

## Models Used
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Techniques
- Data Normalization
- One-Hot Encoding
- Early Stopping
- Model Checkpointing

## Results
CNN significantly outperformed ANN, demonstrating the importance of spatial feature learning in image classification tasks.
